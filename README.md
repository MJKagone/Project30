# Project 30: Sentiment on Technical Debt Dataset

This repository contains the project source code in the techinal_dept_sentiment.ipynb Jupyter notebook file (see requirements.txt). Word lists, empath categorization and sentiment analysis results can be found in the word_lists.csv, empath.csv and sentiment.csv files respectively. As the project has no interactive elements, the notebook suffices for a GUI containing all the results and requiring only running the notebook. (In fact we have left the outputs in the file for the convenience of the viewer, so even this is not strictly necessary.) If there are verbal aspects to the tasks ("discuss the cardinality etc."), these can be found in the project report.
